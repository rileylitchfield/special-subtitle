Project Name: Special Subtitle Plugin<br>
Live Demo: https://testing.rileywebdev.com/2023/01/05/how-to-transfer-files-from-iphone-to-android/ <br><br>
This project gets the field values from the ACF fields and returns the HTML with the special styles applied. <br>
It allows the user to add a shortcode to the post which automatically styles the subtitle. <br>
<br>
The functionality could be extended further to customize the subtitle and save time in editing.<br>
Or, it could add functionality that isn't available or quickly accessible in the post editor. <br>
The subtitle has a 200 character limit. <br>
Adjusted the width of the Special Font Size field so the user can easily see the appended units (px).
